# Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Experience

## Overview

This project is based on the Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Experience on Forage. It involved analyzing malware attacks, responding to security breaches, mitigating cybersecurity threats, and conducting incident post-mortems to strengthen enterprise security resilience.

## Objectives

Investigate and respond to malware incidents
Analyze network traffic to detect suspicious activity
Develop incident response strategies
Conduct security awareness training for stakeholders
## Skills Gained

Malware Analysis & Threat Detection – Identified malicious payloads and attack vectors.
Network Forensics & Packet Analysis – Used Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic anomalies.
Incident Response & Mitigation – Developed and implemented response plans for cybersecurity incidents.
Security Awareness & Reporting – Communicated threats effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
## Key Tasks

**1. Malware Attack Response**

Investigated a simulated malware outbreak affecting company systems.
Identified the attack vector and determined the impact scope.
Recommended containment and eradication measures.

**2. Network Traffic Analysis**

Captured network packets using Wireshark.
Examined suspicious traffic patterns and identified a potential data exfiltration attempt.
Provided insights on mitigating future risks.

**3. Incident Post-Mortem Report**
   
Documented the timeline of the attack.
Evaluated security control failures that enabled the breach.
Suggested improvements for future incident handling.

**4. Security Awareness Training**
Designed phishing awareness and malware prevention training materials.
Targeted teams most vulnerable to social engineering and email-based attacks.
Tools & Technologies Used

Wireshark – Network traffic analysis
Nmap – Network scanning & vulnerability detection
Kali Linux – Security testing environment
Splunk – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Python – Basic scripting for log analysis
Key Takeaways

Proactively identifying threat indicators is crucial for preventing cyberattacks.
Incident response planning minimizes organizational impact during security events.
Continuous security training enhances employee awareness and reduces risk exposure.
